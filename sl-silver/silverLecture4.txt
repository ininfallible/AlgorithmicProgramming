RECURSION/FLOODFILL

What is Recursion?
	A function that calls itself to solve smaller subproblems
	must have a base condition where code terminates
	Benefits: Often much shorter

Execution stack:
	Current function gets paused, nested gets executed
	when nested finishes, current resumes

Be careful with time complexity
	Order of growth can be big

Recursion is often replaceable by iteration


GCD of two numbers using recursion

//assume a greater than b
//no error checking
public int gcd (a, b){
	if (b==0) return a;
	if (a==0) return b;
	return gcd (b, a%b);
}

FLOODFILL:
Filling grids
	identify starting point, recurse on it:
	In Function:
		Recurse in four directions if within bounds, mark as visited
