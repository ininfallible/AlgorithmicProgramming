Sorting arrays in java
	Arrays.sort(arr);
	Collections.sort(arrList);
To compare classes:

within class:
static class Test implements Comparable {
	/*stuff*/
	public int compareTo(Test other) {
		// return 1 if this is greater, -1 if other is greater, 0 if tie
		// greater means in front in sorting
	}
}

int low = MIN-1, high = MAX+1, mid;
while (low+1< high) {
	mid = (low+high)/2
	if(check(mid))
		low=mid;
	else
		high=mid;
}
//answer stored in low
